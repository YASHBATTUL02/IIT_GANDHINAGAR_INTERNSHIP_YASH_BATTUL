# IIT_GANDHINAGAR_INTERNSHIP_TASK_YASH_BATTUL

#In the given task of Machine Learning , Implementation of the JAX library is NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for high-performance machine learning research. . Compilation happens under the hood by default, with library calls getting just-in-time compiled and executed. But JAX even lets you just-in-time compile your own Python functions into XLA-optimized kernels using a one-function API.

# For Task3 
In the given task JAX library is used to build and implement the 3 layer neural network (1- hidden , 2- hidden 3 - output) by using MNIST data set , using the MNiST data set was bit easy because it just for convience to relate with the neural network. Moreover we can also use Imagenet for the same task code for the both will be quite same.
For the same weather the build neuron is correct we used tree map function in the jax using "lamda" function which will give in return shape of leaves which will be fetched from MLP.

# For Task 4
For this task balckjax is used for generating BAYESIAN LINEAR REGRESSION. WHILE Blackjax is written in pure Python but depends on XLA via JAX
Over here
Below mentioned link is data set used as refrence for Plotting the regression graph

to get data easily and plot the graph

# Task 2

Draw the samples from the Multivariate Normal
JAX is used to generate the random number for mean and cov
